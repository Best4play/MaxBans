    #DNSBL results are cached for 1 week, then expire (Are deleted).
    #This is how MaxBans checks for proxied IPs
    # 1.  Have we looked the IP up on DNSBL before, and has it not expired? If so go to 3
    # 2.  Start IP lookup, this takes a few seconds...
    # 3.  If the IP is not a proxy, stop checking, they're allowed, do not proceed to step 4.
    # 4.  Take appropriate action (Kick, notify) if any.
